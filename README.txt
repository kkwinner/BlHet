README for the 3-D model of drug delivery to a bladder cancer metastasis to lung comprised of heterogeneous cell types with different drug resistances, "BlHet," written in Compucell3D(CC3D).

Files:
BlHet.cc3d -- gives the simulator a list of all files used in the sim
BlHet.xml -- initializes static parameters
steppablesBlHet.py -- allows parameters to be changed dynamically in Python, in each time step
BlHet.py -- calls the Python modules from steppablesBlHet.py


Places where paths may need to be changed:
